Code of conduct
===============
There's no strict restriction in controbuting this Vulkan-for-dotnet repository.
But, I (Soha Moon in Republic of Korea who created this repository) **can** treat you not kindly if and only if you do:
- Blame to someone, no matter who the victim is or whether the victim's identity is known.
- Spam to issue board, PR board, or my email(sohaspaces@gmail.com).
- Fork without copying [licsence file](./LICENSCE.md).
- Uploading advertisement which is completely not related to this repository.
- Other bad behaviours which cannot be commonly accepted.
